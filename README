NAME
    Time::Consts - Define time constants with specified base

SYNOPSIS
        # Define all constants.
        use Time::Consts qw/ :ALL /;

        # Define just MIN and HOUR.
        use Time::Consts qw/ MIN HOUR /;

        # Set MIN to base, i.e. SEC = 1/60, MIN = 1, etc.
        use Time::Consts qw/ min SEC MIN /;

DESCRIPTION
    "Time::Consts" can define time constants for you. Those available are

        MSEC
        SEC
        MIN
        HOUR
        DAY
        WEEK

    and are provided as arguments to the "use()" statements. An ':ALL' tag
    is provided to export all of the above. Default base is seconds, but
    that can be changed by supplying a lowercase version of any of the
    constants to the "use" statement. Note that giving a lowercase base
    doesn't mean that the corresponding constant automatically will be
    defined.

    If you at any time would want to have any of the constants in another
    base than the one given to the "use()" statement just divide with that
    constant. E.g. "WEEK / HOUR" will always return 168, i.e. the number of
    hours per week.

DIAGNOSTICS
    Bad argument(s): %s
        (F) Self-explanatory.

    Too many units: %s
        (F) Self-explanatory.
