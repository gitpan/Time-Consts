=head1 NAME

Time::Consts - Define time constants with specified base


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Define all constants.
    use Time::Consts qw/ :ALL /;

    # Define just MIN and HOUR.
    use Time::Consts qw/ MIN HOUR /;

    # Set MIN to base, i.e. SEC = 1/60, MIN = 1, etc.
    use Time::Consts qw/ min SEC MIN /;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Time::Consts> can define time constants for you. Those available are

    MSEC
    SEC
    MIN
    HOUR
    DAY
    WEEK

and are provided as arguments to the C<use()> statements. An ':ALL' tag is provided to export all of the above. Default base is seconds, but that can be changed by supplying a lowercase version of any of the constants to the C<use> statement. Note that giving a lowercase base doesn't mean that the corresponding constant automatically will be defined.

If you at any time would want to have any of the constants in another base than the one given to the C<use()> statement just divide with that constant. E.g. C<WEEK / HOUR> will always return 168, i.e. the number of hours per week.

If you do calendar math consider using a module designed for that.
